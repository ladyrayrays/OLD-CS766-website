                    <h3 class="mb-0">
                        Motivation
                    </h3>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">The problem of identifying produce and then determining the ripeness is important in many fields.
                        For starters looking at the agriculture market, this process can be used in a production line to determine if batches of  a 
                        certain produce are not fit to be sold. For example when putting strawberries in a plastic container that will be 
                        be sent to stores. If it could be determined that said strawberries were far too ripe, they could be discarded early. This fixes the issue 
                        of a package of strawberries arriving at a store with the majority of them already starting to rot or having a very short shelf life. Thus
                        saving the store capital from strawberries experiing too fast. 
                        <br><br>
                        Another area this problem is important to, is the field of accessibility. Individuals who cannot rely on their sight face the issue of
                        determining if food has gone bad, oftentimes they rely on smell and touch. The ability to take a photo of produce and identify if
                        it’s safe to eat is a useful tool. Considering there are already other accessibility tools that allow those with impairments to
                        take images of something to determine what is. The ability to determine ripeness of produce would be a nice addition in making lives of those who 
                        have impairments easier.
                        <br><br>
                        The solution to this problem is also relevent to your average person. Someone who is out shopping for produce and is not well
                        versed in the ripe stages of the produce can use our solution to determine which/when to buy. This could be used to help those who are growing
                        their own produce to help with harvesting them as well. 
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, this problem is interesting, because it solves practical problems for those in everyday life and those in the marketplace.

                    <p class="lead mb-5">General quality control applications of computer vision are present throughout the agricultural industry today.
                       There are large systems in  agricultural settings that are leveraging computer vision for sorting size, quality, 
                       and ripeness of produce. In many of these large scale cases they are looking at some basic shape/color information. 
                       In contrast on the less industrial side of things there have been some developments for monitoring food quality in a grocery 
                       setting or on an even smaller scale there has been some smartphone integration for specific evaluations. One example of this is
                       Amazon Fresh’s ‘Just Walk Out’ technology that uses computer vision to track grocery items taken. In regards to recent publications 
                       there have been some recent papers of interest that leverage convolutional neural networks (sometimes pre-trained) to classify
                       images of certain varieties of produce.[1,2] </p>

                <div class="resume-section-content">
                    <h2 class="mb-0">Method</h2>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">Our initial plan was to explore similar implementations to existing solutions, in regards to other agricultural quality
                        imaging. This meant leveraging some of the edge/color detection content that was covered in lecture over the course of the
                        semester. We then explored the utilization of a convolutional neural network to assist with quality/ripeness classification.
                        If we determine that implementation of a neural network with sufficient training is infeasible due to resource constraints or poor
                        performance we would consider focusing more so on the traditional detection methods we are exploring in class. In order to train this
                        algorithm we tried to identify an existing image dataset with sufficient data samples. For insights and examples we explored a text 
                        through the university library system that aligns with this project.[3] For feasibility, the potential traits we
                        were focused on for identification were color and shape. </p>

                        <p class="lead mb-5">The dataset we used was the Real-world Tomato Image Dataset for Deep Learning and Computer Vision Applications 
                        Involving Precision Agriculture which had a great deal of benefits.[4] We then manually labeled each image through a Matlab script and
                        downsacaled the resolution to XXX as the images were too large to process in an efficient manner. An image could be labeled with any
                        of the following: (1)blossing/bud; (3)beginning to ripen(green/yellow); (3)ripe(orange/red).
